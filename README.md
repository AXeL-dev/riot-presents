Riot Presents
=============

A Riot slideshow components to create HTML presentations inspired by [react-presents](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-presents) & [Slidr](https://github.com/sarfraznawaz2005/Slidr).

Example Usage
-------------

To setup your own slides you need to modify the [slides.js](js/slides.js) file & fill up the `slides` array with your data like so:

```javascript
var slides = [
    {
        title: 'First slide',
        type: 'title'
    },
    {
        title: 'Second slide'
    },
    {
        title: 'Third slide',
        type: 'title'
    }
];
```

That's it!

**Note**: you can merge all the tag files into one file/component to simplify the inclusion of riot-presents into your projects.
